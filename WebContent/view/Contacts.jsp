						<h2>Short but rich history</h2>
						<div class="pad pad_bot1">
							<p class="pad_bot2">The plan to launch Wizz Air was conceived
								in June 2003 when six people with a wide range of airline
								expertise and successful track records teamed up with József
								Váradi, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. In just three
								months, Wizz Air was a registered company ready to fly. The
								first flight took off on the 19th of May 2004 from Katowice.
								Today Wizz Air offers over 420 routes from 25 bases in the
								region: Gdansk, Lublin, Poznan, Katowice, Warsaw and Wroclaw in
								Poland; Budapest and Debrecen in Hungary; Sofia in Bulgaria;
								Bucharest, Cluj-Napoca, Tirgu Mures, Iasi, Sibiu, Craiova, and
								Timisoara in Romania; Kyiv in Ukraine; Prague in Czech Republic;
								Belgrade in Serbia; Vilnius in Lithuania; Skopje in Macedonia;
								Riga in Latvia; Tuzla in Bosnia and Herzegovina; Kutaisi in
								Georgia and Kosice in Slovakia. Following a decade of solid
								growth to become Central and Eastern Europe’s largest low-cost
								airline. Wizz Air successfully completed an initial public
								offering on the 25th of February 2015, and was admitted to the
								London Stock Exchange. The company is now listed on the LSE
								under the ticker WIZZ and employs more than 2600 people. On its
								11th anniversary in May 2015, WIZZ announced a full brand
								rejuvenation and new aircraft livery to respond to maturing
								traveller requirements, taking its place among Europe’s major
								airlines. WIZZ moved to a more vibrant, fresh, sophisticated
								look and feel. Few of the initiatives introduced in conjunction
								with the branding initiative were seat allocation, priority
								boarding, enhanced fare system, amongst many others. Wizz Air
								was named 2016 Value Airline of the Year by Air Transport World,
								a leading industry magazine.</p>

							<h2>Service offering</h2>
							<p class="pad_bot2">Wizz Air is a value-oriented airline
								focusing on innovation all along the way of the customer
								journey. Our aim is to make flying affordable for the citizens
								of the CEE, as well as to provide a new travel experience to all
								travelers in the EU. The latest technology is deployed to ensure
								that the Wizz Air experience is outstanding both in terms of
								service and value for money. We offer a simple service model:
								ticketless travel, cost and time efficient secondary airports,
								single class all-leather seat configuration and catering on
								demand for an additional cost. Our new, best-in-class technology
								aircraft is maintained by some of the most reputable companies,
								such as Lufthansa Technik. This enables the company to achieve a
								consistently high standard of service for travellers.</p>
							<h2>Airports and network</h2>
							<p class="pad_bot2">Wizz Air is continuously looking for
								opportunities to expand its network of destinations and provide
								low-cost air transport. We are committed to achieving the lowest
								cost base in the Central and Eastern European region and airport
								choice has a crucial impact. This is why we fly to a mix of
								primary, secondary and regional airports, providing friendly and
								fast customer service for low costs, which are reflected in WIZZ
								fares. We are in constant negotiations to establish a network of
								operations at more airports.</p>
							<h2>People</h2>
							<p class="pad_bot2">We believe that people make all the
								difference. Our team – both onboard and on the ground - share
								the same passion: the passion for the aviation business. The
								WIZZ team believes in high ethical standards driven by an
								excellent team-playing approach. Our airline employs dedicated
								staff from different countries all over Europe. Thanks to the
								highly committed, professional and multi-cultural management
								team, leadership and motivation is the driving force and a key
								success factor in the WIZZ way of conducting business.</p>
							<h2>Wizz Air fleet</h2>
							<p class="pad_bot2">Wizz Air has a young, single type Airbus
								fleet from the A320 family including A320s and an A321ceo. Wizz
								Air took delivery of its first A321ceo aircraft in November 2015
								and will take over 20 more through 2018. Wizz Air has an order
								with Airbus for 110 new technology A321neo aircrafts with
								advanced systems and engines that will further reduce Wizz Air’s
								industry leading cost base as well as the company’s carbon
								footprint. All new deliveries are fitted with Sharklet wingtip
								devices.</p>
